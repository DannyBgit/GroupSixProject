# GroupSixProject

The aim of this project is the creation of a text based music player in which
the user will be able to choose to play files from the users personal device
with various functions such as the ability, to pause, skip and create playlists

The user will be met with a simple menu of different choices although the level of 
experience required to use this will be low

The program will be capable of playing both mp3 and wav file formats for added
variablity in user choice 

Future versions of the program will hope to have other user features such as 
volume control, selecting other songs, restarting current songs,
the ability to shuffle playlists or select a track at random and automatic
queing of next song
