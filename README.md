# GroupSixProject

The aim of this project is the creation of a text based music player in which
the user will be able to choose to play files from the users personal device
with various functions.

The user will be met with a simple menu of different choices although the level of 
experience required to use this will be low

The program will be capable of playing both mp3 and wav file formats for added
variablity in user choice
